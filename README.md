1️⃣ Automatic Translation Mode

How it works

If a user sends a message without any prefix, the bot will automatically detect the language and translate it into the six remaining languages.

The translations will appear with the correct syntax used in the chat.

Example:

User: Hello everyone, how are you?
Bot:
    $translate en ja Hello everyone, how are you?
    %translate en es Hello everyone, how are you?
    &translate en ru Hello everyone, how are you?
    /translate en de Hello everyone, how are you?
    (translate en it Hello everyone, how are you?
    )translate en fr Hello everyone, how are you?

2️⃣ Manual Translation Mode

How to use it

Use the prefix !m<language_code> <message> to manually specify the source language.

The bot will translate the message from the selected language into the other six languages.
